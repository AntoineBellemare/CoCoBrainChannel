Pure Data and Python tools for creative and aesthetic neurofeedback

This repository is a work-in-progress.
It builds on EEGsynth architecture to easily compute features of brain signals and communicate to PureData (or any OSC compatible software) 
in order to facilitate the fluency of complex computation (Python) with real-time audio processing (PureData).

The BioTuning Library make uses of brain signal spectral information to easily construct musical harmonic structures.
